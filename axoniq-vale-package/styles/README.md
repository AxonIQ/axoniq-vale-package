# Vale Package

This folder contains the configuration for AxonIQ Vale package.

Since vale v3.0, [config folder structure for vocabularies has changed](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/vocab/#folder-structure) and Vocabularies have been moved from `<StylesPath>/Vocab` to `<StylesPath>/config/vocabularies`.

Temporarily, we keep a symbolic link in `Vocab` to `/config/vocabularies` to keep compatibility for older versions of vale.
